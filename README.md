## 🌐 Live Application

🔗 **App Link:**
👉 [https://oil-spill-detection-gamma.vercel.app/](https://oil-spill-detection-gamma.vercel.app/)

---

## 📌 Overview

An **AI-powered oil spill detection system** that uses **deep learning and satellite imagery** to automatically detect and segment oil spills. The system enables **fast, accurate, and scalable environmental monitoring**, reducing dependence on manual inspection.

---

## 🌊 Problem Statement

Traditional oil spill detection methods rely on **manual satellite image inspection** or **physical patrolling**, which are:

* ⏳ Time-consuming
* ❌ Error-prone
* 🚨 Delayed in emergency situations

This increases environmental and economic damage.

---

## 🧠 Proposed Solution

Using **CNN / U-Net based deep learning models**, the system:

* 🔍 Identifies oil spill patterns in satellite images
* 🧩 Generates precise segmentation masks
* 🚨 Supports early intervention and real-time monitoring
